      <description>&lt;p&gt;My interest in using the command prompt(cmd) continues to grow,primarily because of how much time it saves me. However, using it daily means typing repititive commands which becomes tedious. Accessing frequently used directories means repeatedly typing &lt;strong&gt;cd&lt;/strong&gt; (command for change directory) along with directory paths. This is where &lt;em&gt;batch programming&lt;/em&gt; comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;directory&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;folder&lt;/em&gt; refer to the same thing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batch programming, also known as batch scripting, involves using batch files(or batch scripts) to execute commands. A batch file contains a set of commands that are executed in a computer,mostly system tasks. I use batch scripts to streamline repetitive actions. For instance, you can create a batch script to launch your favourite apps when your computer starts. In this article, I demonstrate how to use a batch script to quickly switch my current working directory to a desired location using a shortcut, avoiding the need to repeatedly type &lt;strong&gt;cd&lt;/strong&gt; commands and paths.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
